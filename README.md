## Introduction
[Placeholder Name] is a hotel booking system that allows users to make hotel reservation seamlessly. With the boom of the Millennial traveler, now more than 700 million people are expected to book primarily online by 2023. With that in mind, we are working on a hotel booking system software where guests can choose how long they will stay, the type of room they want, get add-ons, and pay securely online through a payment platform. The system will incorporate the following features, with updates to come in the future: 
1. A fast text-based autocomplete search that can suggest relevant places / destinations as users type a destination
2. For a given destination, the dates of stay and number of rooms/guests, the website will return a list of matching hotels as well as the cheapest room for each hotel. 
3. For a given hotel, the system will make an API call to provide a list of all matching room types that can be provided by the specified hotel.
4. Once decided, a customer will mae their booking and provide payment via a payment gateway. The booking information is then stored in a database with some security features implemented to ensure user privacy.
